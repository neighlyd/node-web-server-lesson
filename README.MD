## Express Server & Handlebars Templating

This section focuses on request and response routing using the [express npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).

We will be using [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars) as our view templating engine of choice (alternatives include [EJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) and [Pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug)).

The section deploys to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) as our site's host.

The section begins by reviewing the request and response cycle of express, then moves on to including middleware for authentication and content injection.
